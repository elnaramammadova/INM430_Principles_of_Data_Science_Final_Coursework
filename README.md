Abstractâ€”In this study, the focus is understanding the subsurface geology present at three well locations in block 15/9 in Volve Field, located in the Norwegian North Sea, by use of a variety of electrical measurements generated from well logging technologies. Petrophysical data analysis were applied in an integrated approach, coupled with thorough data cleaning and outlier removal, to study the log (curve) responses of the wells and asses the feasibility of distinguishing different lithological trends. Specifically, unsupervised cluster analysis using K- Means Clustering algorithm were used to group well log measurements into distinct lithological groupings, known as facies.
